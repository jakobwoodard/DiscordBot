This is a discord bot that I created to enhance my Python skills. This bot has a few capabilities,
some more interesting than the others. The basic capabilities include flipping a coin and playing a
guessing game. One of the more advanced features is being able to scrape the "GolfMoose" website and 
present the user with the available deals in each region of the country. There is also feedback from the 
bot as to the correct syntax for the user so that if needed, the user can correct any mistakes in inputing
the command.

While overall the file size is small, the learning experinece of webscraping, custom webhooks, and combining
multiple python libraries was unique and productive.
